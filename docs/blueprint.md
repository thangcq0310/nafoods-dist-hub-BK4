## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant orange (#FF7F50), evoking a sense of energy and focus on distribution. This will create contrast in a dark scheme.
- Background color: A dark, desaturated orange (#26221F) providing a professional, modern feel, optimized for readability and visual comfort.
- Accent color: A slightly lighter orange (#FF9F50) will be used to highlight actionable items, creating intuitive affordances in the user interface.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will ensure clear and efficient communication in denser blocks of text.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font, to lend a computerized, slightly techy feel to headers. 
- Use clear and modern icons that match the distribution and logistics domain. Icons must be consistent and intuitive.
- Responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across devices.
- Use subtle animations to provide feedback and guide users through interactions.
